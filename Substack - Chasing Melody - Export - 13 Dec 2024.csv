I celebrated my 4th birthday at the station. After a while, he became a paramedic. He didn't talk much about his experiences, but I know they weren't pleasant. It can't be easy responding to a car crash in the middle of the night, to then come home and continue like you hadn't just witnessed the death of someone the same age as your son. As you can imagine, he was always the first person called in an emergency. Somebody's hurt? Call Dad. Broken bone? Call Dad. You need an ambulance? Call Dad. No matter what he encountered, he never grew flustered. I've come to view calmness as a superpower. Something worth practising. An emotion to be called on. Here's why: Calmness makes everybody around you better. When one person stays calm, it's easier for others to do the same. That leads to better thinking and decision-making. Calmness is valuable in every single situation. I can't think of a scenario where it isn't useful. Whether your house is burning down, you're closing the biggest deal of your life, or your bride is walking down the aisle, you want to feel calm. Calmness quiets the lizard brain. In a state of panic, your amygdala, which is your lizard brain, takes over and puts you in a fight-or-flight state. You seek the quickest decision that guarantees survival. It makes it difficult to think laterally or creatively. Calmness quiets the amygdala so that you can assess the situation and explore different perspectives. You can come up with creative and new ideas. That's valuable in every setting, but it's particularly valuable in a business setting where, ironically, creative thinking and lateral ideas are your survival. Stay calm.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/calmness-is-a-superpower","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/calmness-is-a-superpower","230632","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/zd40f6qdv7/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-calmness-is-a-superpower.html"

It got me thinking about my appetite for risk. I grew up in a middle-class home. While we never went without anything, we never found ourselves with excess money. Our friends and family were the same. The people I grew up around were cautious by nature. Risk was seen as something to be avoided. For some reason - which I'm yet to figure out - I have a larger appetite for risk than they do. It's not that I seek or crave risk, but rather that I've come to believe that without risk there is no opportunity. Risk is the price you pay for a shot at greatness. Moving outside of my immediate circles, I remain an outlier. My generation is terrified of risk. Everybody wants to become a consultant or an accountant - two of the most risk-averse career paths out there. People pursue these careers, but almost none of them enjoy what they do. They're open about their dislike for their career and admit that they would rather be doing anything else. So why on earth do people keep pursuing careers like this? Why do they remain on a path they don't want to be on? Careers like consulting and accountancy come with the promise of optionality. The promise that the path you're on leads to choice, and freedom, and your pick of jobs just a little further along the way. It's a promise that has taken hold of my generation. We've become obsessed with accruing optionality. Mihir Desai is a professor at both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School, putting him in contact with more high-achieving young folks than pretty much anyone. Five years ago, Dr Desai wrote about The Trouble with Optionality in The Crimson. He says: This emphasis on creating optionality can backfire in surprising ways. Instead of enabling young people to take on risks and make choices, acquiring options becomes habitual. You can never create enough option value-and the longer you spend acquiring options, the harder it is to stop. The Yale undergraduate goes to work at McKinsey for two years, then comes to Harvard Business School, then graduates and goes to work Goldman Sachs and leaves after several years to work at Blackstone. Optionality abounds! This individual has merely acquired stamps of approval and has acquired safety net upon safety net. These safety nets don't end up enabling big risk-taking-individuals just become habitual acquirers of safety nets. The comfort of a high-paying job at a prestigious firm surrounded by smart people is simply too much to give up. When that happens, the dreams that those options were meant to enable slowly recede into the background. For a few, those destinations are in fact their dreams come true-but for every one of those, there are ten entrepreneurs, artists, and restaurateurs that get trapped in those institutions. I'm not saying that options are bad. Having choices is a good thing. There's value in trying different paths, learning about yourself, and creating optionality before going all-in. I'm saying that our inability to commit is bad. Our tendency to acquire safety net upon safety net without ever taking a leap is bad. Optionality is only as valuable as the things that it allows you to commit to, and if you never commit to something, that optionality dies with you, worthless, unable to be redeemed. One of the reasons people look at artists with a sense of longing is because they know what they want to do. They want to make art. They want to make music. They want to create. The path is challenging but artists pursue it anyway. And the reason they do is that they know that nothing is more important than making art. Artists aren't accruing optionality. Your life has an expiration date. You can spend 40 years of your career constantly chasing ""the next step,"" just to look back and realise you never pursued a single job that you actually liked. I'm not saying that you should fire from the hip and hope that everything works out, but the idea that every period of our lives should be some stepping stone for an ever-present ""next stage"" is a recipe for disaster. In fact, the longer you wait in your life to take risks, the more difficult it is. The more you have to lose, the more unrealistic the rewards have to be to get you into the game of risk. Your risk appetite decreases with age, meaning you need to take big risks early. If you're young, this is your window. This is your time to take risks. That window will close as you hit your thirties and forties because your decisions will no longer be entirely your own. There will be people that depend on you. You'll have accumulated wealth and status and standing that you don't want to risk. But early in your career - early in your life - the worst that can happen if you take big risks is that you move back in with your parents. And that's not shameful if you've thrown yourself out there and committed to going for greatness. Look around you. How many people have been building optionality, creating a platform and safety net to take a big leap? Ambitious people compete insanely hard to accumulate options for the future, instead of figuring out what they really want to do and doing it. It's like spending your whole life filling up the gas tank without ever driving. The truth is, it takes time to build anything significant. It takes years to build a company from scratch, raise a loving family, or master a difficult skill. Sooner or later you have to call your shot and dive in. Sooner is almost always better.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/why-are-there-so-many-accountants","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/why-are-there-so-many-accountants","267188","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/1wu3rtt5ug/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-why-are-there-so-many-accountants.html"

He went from a teen founder failing to get traction, to President of Y Combinator, to founder of OpenAI. Those seem like big, random jumps. It's easy to think Altman's career has been littered with luck. Sure, luck played a part - as it always does - but the deeper you dig the clearer it becomes that luck was nothing more than a footnote in his story. Altman navigated those big, random jumps flawlessly and now finds himself at the helm of the most exciting company in the world. How did he get that good? Altman's first startup was Loopt, a location-based social networking app. The company was founded in 2005 and was initially funded by Y Combinator. In 2012, it was acquired for $43 million. Loopt had more than five million users but is alleged to have struggled to gain traction. It was a passive location-tracking app - once you turned it on, it continued to tell your friends where you were. At that time, those apps were the new darlings of tech. It became only the latest location app to be acquired and see its own product shut down, following others like Gowalla and Yobongo. In 2014, Altman became the President of YC. Becoming President of YC after going through the program is like becoming Dean of Harvard after being a student. Altman was the second-ever President and was hand-picked by Paul Graham. Why? Because he really, really impressed Paul Graham. Graham wrote an essay in 2009 listing Altman alongside Steve Jobs and Larry/Sergey as the 5 most interesting startup founders of the last 30 years. Graham notes (emphasis mine): 'I was told I shouldn't mention founders of YC-funded companies in this list. But Sam Altman can't be stopped by such flimsy rules. If he wants to be on this list, he's going to be… there are a few people with such force of will that they're going to get whatever they want.' Honestly, Sam is, along with Steve Jobs, the founder I refer to most when I'm advising startups. On questions of design, I ask 'What would Steve do?' but on questions of strategy or ambition I ask 'What would Sama do?' That's not just impressing someone. That's knocking their socks off. How did he do it? Altman Has Off-the-Charts Ambition Altman exudes extreme belief and ambition in everything he does. He shows ridiculous conviction in his decisions and I suspect that combination of belief and conviction create the 'force of will' that Paul Graham uses to describe him. I've studied Steve Jobs deeply and Altman shares this trait with him. Jobs was famous for what observers called his 'reality distortion field.' Part motivational tactic, part drive and ambition, he was notoriously dismissive of phrases like 'It can't be done' or 'We need more time.' Jobs learned early in life that reality was falsely framed by rules and compromises that people had been taught as children. He had a much more aggressive idea of what was or wasn't possible. To him, when you factored in vision and work ethic, much of life was malleable. Altman sees life through the same lens: 'A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time-most people don't even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are' - Sam Altman Brian Chesky, founder of AirBnB, tells a story about Altman that showcases this trait. Chesky shared that when they entered YC, they had doubts about their survival, but their ambition grew as they progressed in the program. That growth was largely due to their interaction with Altman, who was then an unpaid mentor and fundraising expert at YC. When the Airbnb team presented Altman with a slide deck for a $500,000 seed funding round, Altman encouraged them to increase their projected revenue from $30 million to $3 billion. Altman said, 'Take all the M's and make them B's. Either you don't believe everything you said in the rest of the deck, or you're ashamed, or I can't do math.' Altman displayed this willingness to think big throughout his tenure at YC, growing the organisation rapidly during his time there. Similarly, his vision for OpenAI is marked by audacity and a willingness to embrace the unknown. When asked about the company's revenue model in 2019, Altman candidly admitted that they had no plans or ideas for generating revenue, and instead stated that their goal is to build a generally intelligent system that can figure out how to generate returns for investors. This statement may seem outlandish to some - it drew a lot of laughter from the crowd - but it's a testament to Altman's unwavering confidence in his ability to achieve the impossible.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/lessons-from-sam-altman-on-belief","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/lessons-from-sam-altman-on-belief","281042","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/dtctu4t0ov/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-lessons-from-sam-altman-on-belief.html"

Another wants to be a botanist. Another dreams of owning fast food franchises and optimising the processes that run them. Other people might want the Tim Ferris and Joe Rogan type of freedom, where they get to nerd out on their obsessions with millions of fans. Others might want the Paul Graham type of freedom: create iconic companies. Quit at the top. Prioritise family and spend your days reading and writing. Some may want the Brunello Cucinelli type of freedom - a couple of hours of exercise each day, a walk to work, a siesta after lunch, and evenings spent surrounded by books, or at the local café discussing philosophy, politics, economics, and religion. Everyone has their own idea of freedom. Ask them about it and they'll tell you. How do you frame freedom for yourself? Work and careers fascinate me. Mainly because I think great work stems from finding what you're obsessed with, but also because I've seen firsthand how a job you don't enjoy makes every aspect of your life significantly worse. The truth is we work more than we do anything else-more than we eat, sleep, or see our families and friends. How we spend those hours matters. I've been fortunate to experience the satisfaction and personal growth that work can give you. My first job was delivering robotics education to children living in informal settlements, my second job was as a software engineer building intelligent systems for global water utilities, and my current role is as an early-stage startup delivering super-cheap, super-fast fibre internet to informal settlements in emerging markets. My career up until this point has been maximised for impact. Each role has significantly impacted the lives of the people we build for. It's also been a solid career strategy. Each role has come with increased scope, responsibility and financial reward. If I wasn't trying to maximise impact, it's a reasonable assumption that I'd instead be optimising around personal lifestyle preferences. I might want total freedom to choose how I make my living. Or extreme flexibility in my schedule, including the ability to stop working altogether for long periods of time at short notice. Or I might want to work on a certain kind of problem with certain kinds of people. When I talk to people about their careers and ambitions, the conversation usually leads to freedom and trying to achieve it. There's always some idea of freedom that they're working towards. We spend an awful lot of time pursuing freedom and it seems wasteful to go through all the work of getting it only to realise that it isn't what you actually want. How can you test it along the way? How can you taste freedom before ordering the whole dish? I like the idea of a career break. Taking time away from your work to consider what you truly want to work on, to trial the life you're building towards. I've come to think of these as mini-retirements littered throughout your career and I suspect it's an exercise that can yield a whole lot of clarity and energy. It's not taking 6 months off to do nothing. It's taking a break to learn and explore the things you say you want to but never find the time for. It's 6 months to be a dog trainer. 6 months to take botany classes. 6 months to taste the freedom you crave and decide whether it's worth pursuing. I can't wrap my head around the idea of having just one career for my entire life. Our interests and abilities change as we grow and develop. The things I liked and was good at when I was 18 are vastly different to my strengths and interests now. Our goals and desires change over time. It doesn't make sense to commit to a career for 40+ years based on a decision you made as a naive teenager. These breaks are an antidote to that kind of thinking. They're periods of reflection and introspection. An opportunity to think long-term. An opportunity to live the life you think you want. Whatever idea of freedom you're pursuing, consider a career break when you're 10% of the way there. Don't go 100% of the way and realise you're at the wrong destination.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/the-case-for-career-breaks","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/the-case-for-career-breaks","269239","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/z9fyi1sjqb/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-the-case-for-career-breaks.html"

I shall be in command of the defences of London and I shall save London and England from disaster. Dreams of the future are blurred. But the main objective is clear, I repeat, London will be in danger and in the high position I shall occupy, it will fall to me to save the capital and save the empire.""You won't be surprised to find out that it was Churchill that said those words. What might surprise you is that he said them in 1891 as a 16-year-old schoolboy at Harrow.Churchill, right from the beginning, had a sense of his own destiny. He believed that he was fated to do great things. Forgetting the number of times he could have died in the five wars he fought across four continents, he had enough close brushes with death for many lifetimes. He was born two months premature. He had three car crashes and two plane crashes. He fell off a 30-foot bridge. He stayed in a house that burnt to the ground in the middle of the night. He nearly drowned in Lake Geneva. He was stabbed as a schoolboy and had four serious bouts of pneumonia - one that nearly killed him as a child.Reading this, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Churchill's life sounds like a video game. The great British adventurer, surviving endless scrapes and coming back to tell the tales. Campaigning around the world performing insane feats of courage and bravery to defeat anyone that stood between him and the next level. Churchill was the main character.I've explored various founders and leaders on this blog over the past few months. There hasn't been a plan of attack - it's been guided by curiosity - but certain themes have continually popped up. Themes like agency, a bias for action, and irrational self-belief have revealed themselves in almost all the founders we've looked at.I've written about these things partly because I enjoy studying great leaders, but mainly in the hopes that identifying the traits that played a part in their success might help me develop those traits myself. While knowing about these traits is useful, it's a pretty ineffective strategy for cultivating them yourself. It's not actionable enough. That's where today's piece comes in.Viewing your life as a video game is a useful framing because it helps you embody all of these traits. We need to see ourselves as the protagonist. We need to have agency and take action. We need to proceed in the belief that we're destined to do great things.In short, we need to stop being non-player characters.A non-player character (NPC) is a background character in a video game that wanders around to add atmosphere or give you information if you interact with them. On platforms like Twitter and Reddit, it's used to call people unimportant or boring, an insult to describe someone who doesn't think for themselves.Churchill is the opposite of this. He's daring and brave and courageous and goes from level to level flying on the belief that he's destined for great things. He's the main character, and there's no doubting it.If your aim is to be more like the greats that have come before us, being an NPC won't cut it. We need to see ourselves as the main character. We need to be the one who is going to save London and England from disaster.In Building the High-Agency Habit I wrote:Our lives are full of defaults. Schools you should attend, careers you should pursue, things you're allowed to do. Peer pressure makes it easy to fall into following defaults… Agency is about noticing when these defaults constrain you and being willing to break them. It's being able to think for yourself.Thinking of your life as a video game helps you do this because there are multiple ways to progress. Not just multiple known ways, but backdoors and cheat codes that allow you to progress faster and further than you imagined possible.Life is the same in that there are multiple paths to follow. You can take back doors and skip levels and move quicker than you think. Progress isn't linear. You don't have to follow the default path laid before you.Part of this mindset is taking responsibility - realising that you can do things and influence the world and that by taking it upon yourself to fix or improve something the world will be better than if you did nothing.One of the best parts of adopting the video game perspective of life is that you begin to see situations not as life or death but as opportunities to experiment and learn. Sure, you might fail and have to start the level again, but is that really so bad?We all have our own objectives and we have to choose the best way to achieve them. And by thinking of your life as a video game, by treating it as an experiment and seeking out backdoors, you'll progress faster, learn more, and enjoy the journey.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/stop-being-a-non-player-character","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/stop-being-a-non-player-character","255249","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/36ad1rl7lm/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-stop-being-a-non-player-character.html"

People are often either good at high-level strategy or atomic-level execution, but rarely both. In other words, successful founders are able to see the big picture and the details at the same time. They can shift their perspective from 30,000 feet to ground level and back again. They can see the forest from the trees. It's challenging because high-level strategy and atomic-level execution require different skill sets. High-level thinking is about being able to hold multiple concepts in your mind at one time. Atomic-level thinking is about focus and execution; blocking out the multiple concepts that could be on your mind and focusing on the most important thing you can do right now. The ability to shift from high-level strategy or atomic-level execution is a valuable skill for any founder, but also for any startup team member. Being able to see both the big picture and the details is a rare combination. Will Ahmed, the founder and CEO of WHOOP, is especially good at this. He speaks about the origins of WHOOP. He says: ""I was someone who used to overtrain, where you get fitter and fitter, and then you sort of fall off a cliff. It's the ultimate betrayal in sports… Ahmed zoomed in on the details by reading those papers. He developed a deep understanding of how to measure strain and recovery in the body. At the same time, he zoomed out on the wearables industry and figured out how his learnings could be morphed into a product that sits on your wrist. He was holding multiple concepts in his head and trying to synthesise them into one convincing offering.

Great work is a combination of many things, but the most important is obsession. Read a book about Steve Jobs, or listen to an interview with Michael Jordan, and you'll feel that obsession. People that do great work are so intensely interested in what they're doing that the world outside of that seems to stop. The three points above could simply say ""find what you're obsessed with.""If obsession precedes great work, what precedes obsession? Brie Wolfson gives us a clue1:When investors are looking to make bets on companies, they look for product-market fit. I think we can and should use that same framework to make bets on talent. That same magical spark that ignites when a company finds their perfect place in the market happens when a person finds the right problem to work on. Let's call it person-problem fit.Because if we're going to have the dynamite careers we aspire to, and be rewarded accordingly, it's going to start with figuring out what holes are you-shaped. I've heard this described before as ""playing the right game,"" or ""climbing the right ladder,"" but I think it's about more than that. I think it's about finding the things that light you up inside so much that you can't help but dive in and do things you are wildly proud of.If that final line isn't describing obsession, I don't know what is.Seeking Genuine InterestThe first step-perhaps the most enormous step-is to find what you are genuinely interested in. Genuine interest is a map that leads to endless opportunities for improvement. The sooner you find it the more it all compounds.But knowing what you're interested in is tricky. It's deceptively innocent. It feels obvious; like you should know it. Yet most people don't.I'm 26 and it's an interesting age because until this point everyone has followed a similar path. In school, even if you're the brightest, you can only get so far ahead. In university, while people begin to explore different ideas, everyone remains somewhat comparable.But mid-twenties are when you begin to forge your own path. The rest of your life starts to take shape and the guidelines offered in school or university disappear. The decision of what impact you want to have on the world is yours and yours alone.Many of my friends have started questioning their careers and what they want to do moving forward. I pivoted careers straight out of university and often get asked about it. Something interesting about these conversations is that most people have no idea what they're genuinely interested in. It's not just that they're uncertain; they're stumped. They don't know what life looks like away from the path they've been following for so long.One of the reasons people fail to think about what they actually want to do is that society does the thinking for them. 'Man is the creature who does not know what to desire,' wrote Girard, 'and he turns to others in order to make up his mind.' He called this mimetic desire and it explains why so many people find themselves following paths they hate: everyone else is doing it too, so it must be right.I recently re-read Shoe Dog, the story about Nike, written by it's founder Phil Knight. It's a phenomenal book, and a paragraph at the end jumped out at me:God, how I wish I could relive the whole thing. Short of that, I'd like to share the experience, the ups and downs, so that some young man or woman, somewhere, going through the same trials and ordeals, might be inspired or comforted. Or warned. Some young entrepreneur, maybe, some athlete or painter or novelist, might press on. It's all the same drive. The same dream. It would be nice to help them avoid the typical discouragements.I'd tell them to hit pause, think long and hard about how they want to spend their time, and with whom they want to spend it for the next forty years. I'd tell men and women in their midtwenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don't know what that means, seek it. If you're following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you've ever felt.And that's why it's so important to know what interests you most. To be able to pull out the map and navigate the path ahead of you. And no one but you -not your manager, not your partner, not your parents - can do that work for you. It's on you to find the things that light you up inside so much that you can't help but dive in and do things you are wildly proud of.In ClosingInterest is a weird thing to talk about. But the reason I did is that it's so often overlooked. Deeply questioning what I'm interested in hasn't led to absolute answers. Instead, it's been a way of clarifying the things I'd been chasing, thinking of them in ways I hadn't thought of before. It led me to rethink a lot of the decisions I'd made in the past. Most importantly, it made me rethink the decisions I was about to make.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/in-relentless-pursuit-of-genuine","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/in-relentless-pursuit-of-genuine","279712","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/li7cot5m6v/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-in-relentless-pursuit-of-genuine.html"

Jobs spoke extensively about keyboards. Most phones at the time had physical keyboards - flat plastic keyboards that took up the bottom half of the phone, below a little screen. Jobs slammed this design: (These phones) all have these keyboards that are there whether you need them or not. And they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic, and are the same for every application … well, every application wants a slightly different user interface, a slightly optimised set of buttons just for it. And what happens if you think of a great idea six months from now - you can't add a button to these things - they're already shipped! So what do you do?

It's about Churchill and his leadership of Britain during World War 2. The British knew Germany possessed the ability to bomb England to the point where it might have no other option but to surrender. Germany's bombing of Rotterdam had seemed to validate such thinking. The day after the Luftwaffe's attack, the Dutch surrendered, out of fear that other cities would be destroyed. England's ability to defend itself from this kind of campaign depended entirely on the nation's aircraft industries' capacity to produce fighter aircraft-Hurricanes and Spitfires-at a rate high enough not just to compensate for the fast-mounting losses but also to increase the overall number of planes available for combat. But despite knowing the importance of producing aircraft and producing them fast, fighter production lagged. Shortages of parts and materials disrupted production. Damaged aircraft accumulated as they awaited repair. Many nearly completed planes lacked engines and instruments. Vital parts were stored in far-flung locations, jealously guarded by feudal officials reserving them for their own future needs. With all this in mind, Churchill, on his first day as prime minister, created an entirely new ministry devoted solely to the production of fighters and bombers, the Ministry of Aircraft Production. In Churchill's view, this new ministry was the only thing that could save Britain from defeat, and he was confident he knew just the man to run it: his longtime friend Max Aitken - commonly known as Lord Beaverbrook. Churchill offered him the job that night, but Beaverbrook hesitated. He had made his fortune in newspapers and knew nothing about running factories that manufactured products as complex as fighters and bombers. Beaverbrook's secretaries were still composing draft letters of refusal when, apparently on impulse, he accepted the post. Two days later, he became minister of aircraft production. Beaverbrook was remarkably efficient at ramping up aircraft production. At one point, Adolf Galland - a German pilot who led the Luftwaffe (German Airforce) and was a top-scoring ace - was summoned to the hunting lodge of Hermann Göring, chief of the Luftwaffe, for Göring to air his complaints: ""That afternoon, reports came in about a big raid on London, one of the last conducted in daylight, in which the Luftwaffe suffered major losses. Göring was shattered,"" Galland wrote. ""He simply could not explain how the increasingly painful losses of bombers came about."" To Galland, the answer was obvious. What he and fellow pilots had been trying to get their superiors to understand was that the RAF was just as strong as ever, fighting with undiminished spirit in a seemingly endless supply of new aircraft. A seemingly endless supply of new aircraft. The stakes were high; the fate of England depended on the production of those aircraft. Beaverbrook had been successful in the newspaper industry, but aircraft production was outside his wheelhouse. It didn't matter, because Beaverbrook executed flawlessly. It's easy to place limitations on yourself by thinking that you don't know enough, or that you don't have the correct qualifications, or that you'll simply be out of your depth. And perhaps that's true. But what this story shows is that it doesn't matter. The more I learn about great founders and leaders, the more I realise that most of my idols had no idea what they were doing at multiple points in their careers. They were punching above their weight and figuring it out along the way. Fu#k Around and Find Out I often come across books, blogs and YouTube videos explaining how successful people did what they did. Whether it's starting a company or running an ultramarathon, they usually create the impression that every successful person knew what they were doing each step of the way. That they knew how the next 12 steps would play out. I don't think that's true. Ben Horowitz gets to the heart of it: ""The problem with these books is that they attempt to provide a recipe for challenges that have no recipes. There's no recipe for really complicated, dynamic situations. There's no recipe for building a high-tech company; there's no recipe for leading a group of people out of trouble; there's no recipe for making a series of hit songs; there's no recipe for playing NFL quarterback; there's no recipe for running for president; and there's no recipe for motivating teams when your business has turned to crap. That's the hard thing about hard things-there is no formula for dealing with them."" Something I like about good biographies is that they show how the subject got to where they did. They don't hide the hard parts. Early lives leap out the most. Leonardo da Vinci was a studio apprentice to Verrocchio at 14. Walt Disney took on a number of jobs, chiefly delivering papers, from 11 years old. Andrew Carnegie finished schooling at 12 and was 13 when he began his second job as a telegraph office boy, where he convinced his superiors to teach him the telegraph machine itself. By 16 he was the family's mainstay of income. Biographies reveal failure, too. Dyson built 5,127 prototypes before he eventually created the world's first bagless vacuum cleaner. Jobs was fired from the company he started, saying ""What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating."" The early lives - and the failures along the way - contain something revealing. They reveal that even history's most wildly successful people didn't know how the journey ended when they were walking it. They were often out of their depth and simply trying to take the best next step. They were figuring it out along the way. Richard Hamming, the great Bell Labs engineer, says that ""in science, if you know what you're doing, you shouldn't be doing it."" A less subtle way of putting it: Fuck around and find out. Everything starts as fucking around and everyone at the frontier is almost always doing that. I've come to realise that if I want to do anything significant, I'm going to question my ability and I'm going to doubt myself. That's okay. I'm not the first and I'm not the last, but I must push on. The time for concern is when I stop feeling these things.

He just shamelessly ripped off other people's ideas….He'd be a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger."" Gates had no taste. Their products might have been good, but nobody ever got excited about a Microsoft launch. Jobs, on the other hand, had the best product taste the world has ever seen. It's the difference between Apple and Microsoft. A CEO's core job functions are all driven by taste: recruiting requires good taste in people, a vision requires good taste in business strategy, and leading company culture requires good taste for what a productive work environment feels like. Depending on the type of company you want to build, it's good to know where you lie on the Microsoft to Apple spectrum. And so the question you might ask becomes: what can you do to acquire better product judgment? How might you develop taste? Product building seems to follow one of two parallel paths: the 'customer obsession' path and the 'taste and iterate' path. The 'customer obsession' path is where you ask customers what problems they have and build solutions for them. Frameworks like the Lean Startup are your guidebook on this path, telling you what you need to build at each step of the way. On the 'taste and iterate' path, you don't ask the customer anything. Instead, you iterate internally and rely on the taste and judgment of internal product leaders. Ken Kocienda explains this way of building in his book Creative Selection. In the Creative Selection process, you iterate on demos and present those demos to a hierarchy of product leaders. First you present to your boss, then your boss presents to their boss, and so on up, with the top level being Steve Jobs himself. You are invited to be an evaluator on these product panels if you have proven yourself to have good product taste. The iPhone is one of the best examples of following this path. Consumers could have never asked for an iPhone until they actually saw one first. If you were trying to build it, the customer obsession path wouldn't have taken you very far simply because people that bought iPhones never knew they wanted one. Ben Horowitz, in 'The Hard Thing About Hard Things' points out: ""It turns out that is exactly what product strategy is all about-figuring out the right product is the innovator's job, not the customer's job. The customer only knows what she thinks she wants based on her experience with the current product. The innovator can take into account everything that's possible, but often must go against what she knows to be true. As a result, innovation requires a combination of knowledge, skill, and courage."" The primary difference between the two paths is that one solves a problem the customer knows they're experiencing, and the other solves a problem they never knew they had. Instead of ""let me ask this person what they want and then build it,"" you adopt an attitude of ""I'm going to observe the shit out of this person and surprise them with something they never knew they needed."" The latter is far more challenging. It's also far more valuable, which is why Apple is the most valuable company in the world. Perhaps most importantly, it changes industries forever. If you want to build products that are significantly better than anyone else - the iPhone of your industry - taste is what takes you there. Building great companies is an exercise in taste, with the rewards given to people with the best taste in products, markets and people. People with taste have an intuitive sense of quality, even when they can't describe it. Taste is what lies beyond what can be written down. You have to learn it by feel. Perhaps the best way to develop the taste needed to build a great company is to move yourself into a community that is already doing the things you want to do. Most knowledge that is useful for company building is tacit. Joining a company you want to emulate is the best way to do this because it allows you to throw yourself into the details and learn how it works from the inside. It gives you an intuitive sense of the internal patterns. It's no coincidence that so many successful founders tend to come from already-successful companies. Ultimately, consumption shapes your taste. If you want to refine it, surround yourself with excellence. This is why restauranteurs travel to dine at the world's best restaurants and serious painters do a tour of duty in Paris or New York. It's why you'll benefit from joining a company that seems to have great taste. Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science. I like that intersection. There's something magical about that place… The reason Apple resonates with people is that there's a deep current of humanity in our innovation. I think great artists and great engineers are similar, in that they both have a desire to express themselves."" - Steve Jobs I only stumbled upon Edwin Land recently. Jobs called Land ""a national treasure,"" and modelled much of his career after his. When you learn that Land was the inspiration for many products built at Apple, it makes sense. In 'A Triumph of Genius: Edwin Land, Polaroid, and the Kodak Patent War' the author points out: ""Land was introverted in person, but supremely confident when he came to his ideas… Alongside his scientific passions, lay knowledge of art, music, and literature. He was a cultured person growing even more so as he got older, and his interests filtered into the ethos of Polaroid."" Companies take on the ethos of their founders. Jobs and Land had vast interests. They had a passion for art and beauty and it revealed itself in the products that their companies built. Gates was different. His obsession lay in distributing Microsoft software to every corner of the globe. It's the reason Microsoft is so successful, but it's also why their products are bland and boring. Breadth of experience is valuable. I suspect it's the driving force behind the idea that startups are built by generalists and scaled by specialists. Jobs had wonderful design, typography, storytelling and product taste and he combined those to create products at Apple. He said that ""some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicians on the side."" The book about Edwin Land says ""Land liked people who had breadth, as well as depth. Chemists, who were also musicians or photographers who understood physics."" Leonardo Da Vinci was a master of the arts - painting, drawing, sculpting, engineering, architecture and anatomy. He wrote literature and drew designs for the helicopter at the same desk. He was the kind of genius that gets spoken about centuries after his death. If the intersection of humanities and science were a real place, a statue of Da Vinci would stand at the centre. At this intersection, we find people who are unbelievably creative. People capable of incredible feats. People who are designing, creating and improving the world around them. These are the people we need to act as the navigators of the battering ram that is technology, leading the companies that change the world. Generalists set the direction.

Kanye 🤝 Dyson 🤝 Jobs It's useful to look at the history of the field you want to master. I read a lot about people that have built great companies and products. Reading about Jobs at Apple shows you what's possible when you focus and execute for a really long time. Reading about the hours that Carmack poured into creating Doom shows you what it means to work hard. Reading about the 5,127 prototypes that Dyson built before arriving at his design of the bagless vacuum casts persistence in a new light. I read these stories not just because they're entertaining and inspiring, but because I want to be a great founder myself. There are plenty of lessons in the lives of the greats and it'd be foolish not to learn from them. A lesson that repeats across all of these stories is that almost every great founder had a ridiculous amount of persistence. No matter how many times they were told 'no' their belief in their abilities never wavered. Belief came before ability. Kanye West is one of the best examples of this. Back in the early 2000s, he moved to New York. It was the centre of the hip-hop universe and it's where he needed to be. Jeen-Yuhs, a documentary about Kanye, shows his journey of trying to secure a record deal. He was rejected time and time again, yet his belief in his ability never wavered. At one point, he explains how he used to practice his Grammy speech while walking around the city. He was practising his Grammy speech before he made his first album. His levels of belief and persistence were off the charts. The same persistence is visible in James Dyson. One day Dyson was pushing around his Hoover vacuum and the bag kept blocking the suction. He thought he could do something better. Dyson had spotted a local sawmill using cyclone technology to separate sawdust particles from the air and thought it could work on a vacuum cleaner. He replaced the Hoover's bag with a crude cardboard prototype of his cyclone design and it worked. In the 5 years that followed, Dyson built 5,127 prototypes. He mortgaged his house. But he eventually created the world's first bagless vacuum cleaner. Steve Jobs is called a genius and a visionary but we speak little of how persistent he was. It's easy to celebrate his success at Apple but that's too simplistic a view. It skips over the persistence and stubbornness and refusal to quit that allowed Jobs to achieve what he did. The dozen years between his first tenure at Apple and his return, from 1985 to 1997, are important to study. During that period he experienced countless failures and made a lot of mistakes. It's an important period because it equipped him with the product understanding and wisdom that made his second reign at Apple so legendary. He had to go through it but he was only able to endure it because he was persistent and unrelenting in his desire to revolutionise the world through personal computing. His perseverance was remarkable. Whatever happened, he remained driven, curious, and determined to create beautiful products that would revolutionise computing. Without that, his second act at Apple, the most valuable work he ever did, wouldn't have happened. The failures, tantrums, poor judgement calls, and immaturity led to the clarity, insight, and steadiness he displayed later in life. ""People say you have a lot of passion for what you're doing, and it's totally true and the reason is because it's so hard that if you don't, any rational person would give up. It's really hard and you have to do it over a sustained period of time. So if you don't love it, if you're not having fun doing it, if you don't really love it, you're going to give up. And that's what happens to most people, actually. If you really look at the ones that ended up being successful in the eyes of society, and the ones who didn't, often times it's the ones that are successful that love what they did so they could persevere, you know, when it got really tough. And the ones that didn't love it, quit. Because they're sane, right? Who would want to put up with this stuff if you don't love it? So it's a lot of hard work and it's a lot of worrying constantly, and if you don't love it, you're gonna fail. So, you gotta love it, you gotta have passion."" - Steve Jobs Choose Ignorance Jack Raines recently wrote a piece titled 'Good Ignorance' that captured the value of ignorance. When it comes to perseverance, ignorance is your closest ally. If you fully understand the risks and unlikelihood of success for a new endeavour when you start, you'd probably never do it. But if your ignorance prevents you from quitting, and you keep hacking away day after day, you just might pull it off. Ignorance + discipline can buy you time to succeed. 18-hour days, 7 days a week, was standard.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/belief-before-ability","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/belief-before-ability","267462","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/qfqudqzk68/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-belief-before-ability.html"

The majority of people I speak to say the same. But most decisions don't come with second chances. If I want to make good career decisions now - the jobs and problems I give my attention to - how do I do it? A few ideas off the top of my head, I'd love to hear yours: 1. Talk to people that are currently doing what you think you want to be doing Get very very curious and ask them a lot of questions. Be really honest with yourself and decide if that's something you want to be doing. You probably already know about the good parts of the job (that's why you want to do it), so try to uncover the bad parts and decide if the good outweighs the bad. 2. Ramp up the ambition Most people aren't as ambitious as they should be. Too many people settle for average. If you rarely fail, you probably aren't being ambitious enough. Failure shows you where the boundaries of your abilities lie, and if you never fail, you're playing too far within those boundaries. Failure is like a dial for ambitiousness, crank it up. 3. Do something audacious Sixteen-year-olds aren't supposed to write novels. Lawyers aren't supposed to start billion-dollar technology companies. So if you try, anything you achieve is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing no worse than expectations, and you'll have a story to tell. Don't underestimate the power of a good story. 4. Look for smart people working on important problems and spend time with them Smart people are more introspective about what they work on. They can work on almost anything they want, so they have to approach each option with scrutiny. This scrutiny will spill over into your decision-making and improve it in the process. 5. Be wary of optionality People work insanely hard to accumulate options for the future, instead of figuring out what they really want to do and doing it. That's like spending your whole life filling up the tank without ever driving. It lets you off the hook for doing the hard work of figuring out what it is you want and what you should be doing with your life. 6. Be ridiculously optimistic Individuals and teams can achieve monumental things that change the world permanently. Most people benefit from taking an optimistic view and acting as if individuals can make a very big difference. There's little downside from being too optimistic, and a whole lot of upside if it proves right. 7. Remember that it's ok to look dumb The goal is not to look smart the whole way. Better to look dumb for a bit, but genius at some point, than look merely decent the whole way by taking the safe path.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/making-better-career-decisions","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/making-better-career-decisions","200308","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/6azrryksg4/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-making-better-career-decisions.html"

By the end, everybody in the group had more than 1 million subscribers. The group was his obsession: ""We were very religious about it… they say 10,000 hours to master something, but we probably put in 40,000-50,000 hours."" Thomas Edison was famously opposed to sleeping. In an 1889 interview in Scientific American, the inventor of the lightbulb claimed he never slept more than four hours a night. He thought sleep was a waste of time. Instead, he napped while holding a ball in each hand. As he fell asleep, the orbs would fall to the floor and wake him. This way he could remember the sorts of thoughts that come to us as we are nodding off. John Carmack, creator of Doom and one of the greatest programmers to ever live, says: ""I like working a 60 hour work week. I like being productive… I like building things, I like creating things and making forward progress, this sense of in some small way I'm helping build the future… There are people that think there literally should be laws that should prevent people from working that hard, and I always have to argue against that. There is a power to obsession and being able to absolutely obsess over something I think it's great when people throw themselves at it beyond the point of what even other people think is reasonable. They have free will. They've chosen to do that. And if that's what they think is going to help get them closer to their goals, I'm not going to try to make that impossible for them."" Parents and schools praise balance and moderation. Balancing school work, sports, and a healthy social life was the holy grail growing up. It's the key to achieving in all of these areas. But balance is overrated. Great work appears to be a combination of many things, but the most important is obsession. People that do great work are so intensely interested in what they're doing that the world outside of that appears to stop. If you want to be the leading voice in your field, start great companies, or build cutting-edge technology, balance won't get you there. It might make you good, but it won't make you great. Balance means focusing on two or more things. It creates a tradeoff and makes it difficult to be truly excellent at either one of them. Obsession lies at the heart of genius. Edison, Carmack and Mr. Beast did phenomenal work because they approached it with extreme intensity. Do something that stretches you, that forces you to focus every ounce of your being on it, and notice how it makes you feel. Obsession is electrifying. It's okay to need and want intensity-we praise moderation and balance but it's pretty evident that some people crave a high level of intensity throughout their lives, and that intensity feeds their creativity and productivity and growth.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-obsession","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-obsession","256000","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/lo5mflwy31/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-in-praise-of-obsession.html"

Mothers who went in to give birth often didn't make it out. For example, at Vienna General Hospital's First Obstetrical Clinic, as many as 10% of mothers died of puerperal fever after giving birth. But there was some good news: at the Second Clinic, the number was just 4%. Expectant mothers noticed this - some would get down on their knees and beg to be admitted to the Second Clinic. Others, hearing new patients were being admitted to the First Clinic that day, decided they'd rather give birth in the streets. Ignaz Semmelweis, an assistant at the First Clinic, couldn't bear it. He began desperately searching for some kind of explanation for the difference. He tested many things without success. Then, in 1847, Semmelweis's friend Jakob Kolletschka was performing an autopsy when a student accidentally poked him with a scalpel. It was a minor injury, but Kolletschka got terribly sick and ultimately passed away, with symptoms rather like the ones the mothers had. Which got Semmelweis wondering: was some ""deathly material"" on the corpses responsible for the deaths? To test this, he insisted the doctors begin washing their hands with chlorinated lime (which he found best removed the stink of death) before handling the pregnant women. The results were shocking. In April 1847, the mortality rate was 18.3%. Semmelweis instituted handwashing in mid-May and by June the mortality rate had crashed to 2.2%. The next month it was even less and later that year it reached zero - for the first time ever. You'd think doctors would be thrilled by this incredible discovery. Instead, Semmelweis was ridiculed and attacked. He was fired from the hospital and forced out of Vienna. ""In published medical works my teachings are either ignored or attacked,"" he complained. ""The medical faculty at Würzburg awarded a prize to a monograph written in 1859 in which my teachings were rejected."" Hundreds of mothers continued to die every year. Semmelweis turned to alcohol and his behaviour became increasingly erratic. It's believed that he may have developed Alzheimer's, and in 1865 he was committed to a mental institution. There he was beaten by the guards, placed in a straitjacket, and locked in a dark cell. He died shortly thereafter, at the age of 47, from an infected wound. Why did doctors so stubbornly reject Semmelweis' ideas? Well, imagine being told you were responsible for the deaths of thousands of your patients. That you had been killing the people you were supposed to be protecting. That you were so bad at your job that you were actually worse than just giving birth in the street. People attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones. They build whole careers on some ideas. When someone claims they're false or obsolete, they feel threatened. Look at the history of ideas, and especially the history of science, and you'll notice a pattern in how big things start. Someone proposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, and then it gradually takes over the world. Semmelweis is one example, but on a smaller scale, we find companies like Uber, Netflix and AirBnB. Ideas are the currency of progress. Finding, developing and acting on them is how we move forward. But ideas are fragile; most people don't even start talking about them at all because they sound silly. How do we create the conditions for crazy ideas to flourish? How to find good ideas Ideas improve with iteration and feedback. Very few are good at the start, and like diamonds, they undergo a process of refinement to reveal the ones that are valuable. Crafting an environment for that process to happen is necessary to have good ideas. Here's how: Stay away from people who belittle your ambitions. You want to be around people who don't make you feel stupid for mentioning a bad idea, and never feel stupid for doing so themselves. You want people that are optimistic about the future and will entertain improbable plans. It's ok to look dumb. It's probably a good thing and might even be necessary. If you don't look dumb somewhere along the way you probably aren't remaining open to the really crazy ideas. The willingness to look dumb is crucial to exploring crazy ideas long enough for them to develop into something worthwhile. The goal isn't to look smart the whole way, it's to look smart at the end. Be the first to criticise your ideas. The main reason people don't tell you what they really think is they're afraid of your reaction. But people will feel more comfortable telling you the truth if you start by criticising yourself, showing them that it's OK. Criticising your own ideas will get people discussing them, and that's how they get stronger. It'll also encourage others to share their own crazy ideas with you. Seek conversations with a high rate of idea exchange. The majority of ideas will be bad, but there will be a couple of gems worth exploring. My rate of idea exchange is particularly high with certain people. Whenever I want to talk through ideas I go to them. Find a handful of people that you can do this with. The video below is of Patrick Collison, founder of Stripe, describing what it's like to discuss ideas with Paul Graham. It captures what it looks like to be an idea generating machine.

It was the start of World War II. The French were believed to have one of the strongest armies in the world. In planning for the German onslaught, the rest of Europe banked on French resistance. The UK's Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, wrote in his diary: ""The one firm rock on which everyone was willing to build for the last two years was the French army."" The Germans were expected to take two weeks to reach France. Instead, they marched day and night and arrived in three days. German leaders provided fearless leadership from the front, inspiring their troops to push their bodies well beyond what they thought they could endure, in the name of acting quickly and ruthlessly. The French were unprepared. Their morale took a massive hit Despite being outnumbered and out armoured, the Germans claimed victory in the space of weeks. It wasn't the first time speed led to triumph. Many of Napoleon's contemporaries use the same word to describe him: impatient. Speed was the most important thing to him. He wanted to do everything faster. He was obsessed with moving his troops as fast as possible. It even extended to his personal life. He said: ""If you want to dine well, dine with Cambacérès [his legal advisor]; if you want to dine badly, dine with Lebrun [his treasurer]; if you want to dine quickly, dine with me."" - Napoleon Bonaparte John Boyd, one of the most influential military strategy writers of all time, gives an explanation for the unreasonable effectiveness of moving quickly. Boyd is most famous for the idea of the ""OODA loop:"" human action is an iterated process of observing the world, orienting within it, deciding how to respond and finally acting on the decision. Boyd's claim was that going through the OODA loop faster was a decisive advantage: to win, we should operate at a faster tempo than our adversaries. Better yet, get inside the adversary's Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action loop. This makes you appear unpredictable and creates confusion and disorder among adversaries. Speed Wins Speed is a multiplier for whatever existing effort, resources, and abilities you have. ""People tend to be either slow movers or fast movers and that seems hard to change. Being a fast mover is a big thing; a somewhat trivial example is that I have almost never made money investing in founders who do not respond quickly to important emails."" - Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI The same thing applies to teams. After surveying 2000+ companies, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim proved that what separates elite engineering teams from average and poor ones, is primarily how quickly they ship. Their book, Accelerate, notes that when compared to low performers, high performers have 46 times more frequent code deployments and 440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy. Speed matters. Speed isn't just a competitive advantage; it helps you improve quickly. More speed means more iterations which means more learning. When things change quickly and frequently, learning leads to winning. Speed also leads to more opportunities. If you're known to move fast, more work is sent your way. You're exposed to more problems and different solutions. It's a virtuous cycle of getting better and better and faster and faster. James Somers sums it up when he says: ""The prescription must be that if there's something you want to do a lot of and get good at-like write, or fix bugs-you should try to do it faster. That doesn't mean be sloppy. But it does mean, push yourself to go faster than you think is healthy. That's because the task will come to cost less in your mind; it'll have a lower activation energy. So you'll do it more. And as you do it more (as long as you're doing it deliberately), you'll get better. Eventually you'll be both fast and good."" In other words, the faster you do something the faster you can incorporate the result into what you do next. That means that moving quickly is an advantage that compounds. Being twice as fast doesn't just double your output; it doubles the growth rate of your output. Over time, that makes an enormous difference. Speed as Habit It's pretty clear that fast equals good. Like exercise, it can become habitual. Developing the muscle makes speed a serious competitive advantage. When you feel things start to slow down, ask questions. Questions are your best weapon against inertia. It's as simple as asking ""Why can't this be done sooner?"" Asking it methodically, reliably and habitually can have a profound impact on the speed you operate at. Comfort is a proxy for whether you're going fast enough. If you have a low-level discomfort, a feeling that you're being stretched, you're probably going fast enough. This isn't to say that you should prioritise speed above everything else, but rather that speed should be a consideration in every decision you make. It's about making things go as fast and as smooth as possible. I'll close with my favourite example of moving quickly (it's worth the read): I was working on interrupt handlers and dispatchers for the system when I noticed Steve Jobs peering over the wall of my cubicle. ""I've got good news for you,"" he told me. ""You're working on the Mac team now. Come with me, and I'll take you over to your new desk."" ""Hey, that's great,"" I responded. ""I just need a day or two to finish up what I'm doing here, and I can start on the Mac on Monday."" ""What are you working on? What's more important than working on the Macintosh?"" ""Well, I've just started a new OS for the Apple II, DOS 4.0, and I want to get things in good enough shape so someone else can take it over."" ""No, you're just wasting your time with that! Who cares about the Apple II? The Apple II will be dead in a few years. Your OS will be obsolete before it's finished. The Macintosh is the future of Apple, and you're going to start on it now!"" With that he walked over to my desk, found the power cord to my Apple II, gave it a sharp tug and pulled it out of the socket, causing my machine to lose power and the code I was working on to vanish. He unplugged my monitor, put it on top of the computer, and then picked both of them up and started walking away. ""Come with me. I'm going to take you to your new desk."" - Andy Hertzfeld, lead software engineer on the Macintosh","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/dont-fail-because-you-moved-too-slowly","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/dont-fail-because-you-moved-too-slowly","100838",""

It argues that objectives can be counterproductive for ambitious ideas. It's about innovation, but I found it applies to careers and personal growth too. One of the reasons I enjoyed it so much is because it gave me a valid reason to prioritise novelty and exploration over objectives and output. I think about achievement an awful lot. More than most people, and far more than I should. It's exhausting. It's exhausting because it results in endless comparisons and measurements. Endless questions of whether you're doing enough, whether you are enough, whether you're on track to achieve what you want to achieve. This book questions the value of those objectives. It allows you to think of progress as a process of discovery. It removes any guilt you might have in taking that approach. Sometimes the best way to achieve something great is to stop trying to achieve a particular great thing. One of the things that makes the future so hard to predict is that new technologies don't operate in silos; they're intertwining threads that weave together in unpredictable ways. Consider Uber: for anyone to be able to call a cab from their pocket, GPS, smartphones, payments, and online rating systems needed to combine in ways that their respective inventors couldn't have predicted. The book uses the analogy of stepping stones scattered across a lake shrouded in mist. Peering into the distance to identify a sequence of steps to a far-off goal is not only over-ambitious but potentially harmful. Instead, we should aim to explore the next stepping stone. The genius of the Wright brothers wasn't to invent every necessary component for flight from scratch, it was to recognise that we were only a stepping stone away from flight given past innovations. ""We choose to go to the Moon,"" Kennedy famously said. ""We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."" There was a chain of inventions needed to take a shuttle to space. They didn't come from the space program itself but from people building and experimenting. The moon landing couldn't have succeeded one hundred years earlier, no matter how well planned it might have been, because the stepping stones needed to get there didn't exist yet. While the book is about innovation and invention, these principles apply to broad and open-ended questions like what to do with your life, or what success means to you. Rather than always seeking ways to get where we want to be (and rarely succeeding), perhaps we might simply explore the world from where we are. The idea of being a curious explorer, following and optimising for novelty and interestingness strikes me deeply. It's not a new idea. Viktor Frankl, Holocaust survivor, founder of logotherapy, and author of Man's Search For Meaning says: ""Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, […] Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run-in the long-run, I say!-success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it."" Nassim Taleb describes the flaneur strategy in Antifragile: ""A flaneur is someone who, unlike a tourist, makes a decision opportunistically at every step to revise his schedule (or his destination) so he can imbibe things based on new information obtained."" Taleb's flâneur is someone who seeks out optionality. Because you can't predict what's going to happen, you stand to gain more by positioning yourself in such a way that you always have options (and preferably ones with great upside and little to no downside). That way you can evaluate once you have all the necessary information and make the most rational decision. His flâneur is an experimenter, a master of trial and error. He's a self-learner who is never the prisoner of a plan. The rational flâneur merely needs to a) avoid things that hurt him, b) keep trying new things, and c) be able to recognise when he achieves a favourable outcome. The counterargument comes from Peter Thiel. Thiel writes about a type of person that he calls the indefinite optimist. The indefinite optimist believes that the future will be better, but they don't know exactly how, so they won't make any concrete plans to get there. Thiel condemns this approach and asks: How can the future get better if nobody plans for it? You might answer that evolution isn't planned. It's a valid answer, but the problem is that while making small changes to something that already exists might lead to progress, it's not always a viable strategy. If you're aiming to build a billion-dollar business, intelligent design and planning often work best. ""The greatest thing Jobs designed was his business. Apple imagined and executed definite multi-year plans to create new products and distribute them effectively. A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random."" - Thiel Tesla is the same. For 15 years, Musk has had a vision for Tesla, developed the steps, and executed them. From 'The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)': ""As you know, the initial product of Tesla Motors is a high performance electric sports car called the Tesla Roadster. However, some readers may not be aware of the fact that our long term plan is to build a wide range of models, including affordably priced family cars. This is because the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution. Critical to making that happen is an electric car without compromises, which is why the Tesla Roadster is designed to beat a gasoline sports car like a Porsche or Ferrari in a head to head showdown. Then, over and above that fact, it has twice the energy efficiency of a Prius. Even so, some may question whether this actually does any good for the world. Are we really in need of another high performance sports car? Will it actually make a difference to global carbon emissions. Well, the answers are no and not much. However, that misses the point, unless you understand the secret master plan alluded to above."" The point isn't to say that one approach is better than the other. The planned approach will often be the correct approach. But knowing that an alternative exists is useful, if only because it gets you to ask how you might benefit from more novelty and curiosity. p.s. While writing this, I stumbled across a note I left myself at the start of the year. I wasn't sure where to fit it into the essay, but it felt relevant, so here it is.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/optimise-for-novelty-and-interestingness","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/optimise-for-novelty-and-interestingness","203549","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/ltew0gc46a/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-optimise-for-novelty-and-interestingness.html"

It enabled me to step off the default path, look past my constraints, and be more ambitious and creative about how I achieved my goals. It started with the realisation that I could take agency with my career and life path. In my final year of university, I realised that despite completing a legal degree, I could step away from the default of pursuing a career as an attorney. I spent the next three years learning to code, working as a software engineer building ML systems for global water utilities, and now co-founding a company trying to connect the next billion people to the internet. I think of agency as the ability to get what you want - the general skill of coming up with ambitious goals and achieving them, whatever they are. Learning to cultivate agency has led to me becoming less risk-averse, a better engineer and thinker, and having a clearer idea of how I might have a significant positive impact on the world. Almost all of the best things happen as a result of actively seeking and asking for those things.

Rebuild it and send it to them. A community you're a part of is doing a bad job of capturing social proof? Interview 10 members and send them finished marketing assets. Your favourite podcaster doesn't have a searchable set of episodes? Create it. This is part 2 of a series on high-agency. In part 1 we looked at what agency was and why it's the most important character trait you can develop. Today we're looking at examples of agency in action. Why Examples? High-agency is an abstract idea. It's easy to read about abstract ideas, nodding along as you do, and never implement the ideas you read about. Our brains are bad at grasping concepts from explanations, but good at generalising from specific examples. Use more examples. The mathematician, and Fields Medal winner, Tim Gowers likes to present examples before discussing general concepts. He says: ""Why should it be better to do it that way round? Well, if a general definition is at all complex, then you will have quite a lot to hold in your head. This can be difficult, but it is much easier if the various aspects of the definition can be related to an example with which you are familiar. Then the words of the definition cease to be free-floating, so to speak, and instead become labels that you can attach to bits of your mental picture of the example."" Examples take abstract ideas and make them real. They create a story in your mind of what agency looks like. They're the stepping stones for identifying and acting with agency in your own life. The Examples: Example 1: Burrel Smith becomes lead hardware engineer on the Apple Mac. Example 2: Landing your dream job. Example 3: Applicants going the extra mile. Example 4: Working with Einstein. Agency is permissionless. There's no age limit, no rules, and nothing preventing you from acting with it. It creates opportunities and acts as a catalyst for doing work you want to do with people you want to do it with. This is part 1 in the high-agency series. Part 2 looks at examples of high-agency. Part 3 explains how to begin fostering it yourself.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/agency-in-action","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/agency-in-action","309114","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/y4bjv2w077/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-agency-in-action.html"

They took control of the city and seized more than 70 French ships, almost half of the French Navy. The British were freely sailing supplies into the city and the naval base held vital strategic importance. The French knew they had to recapture Toulon, but the current leadership was failing. Napoleon had caught the eye of some higher-ups because of a political pamphlet he'd written. He was progressive and proactive and they were looking to give him an opportunity. They named him artillery commander and tasked him with driving the British out of Toulon. The first thing Napoleon did was look at the supplies available to him. It didn't paint a pretty picture. The canons were pitiful. The horses were poorly trained. The men didn't know what they were doing. There wasn't enough gunpowder or cannon balls. He started doing everything in his power to get better supplied. He rode back to Paris - where the government was - and told them that he needed supplies. More gunpowder, more cannons, more horses. He sent men into the countryside and nearby towns to see what they could find. He took cannons from city walls of nearby cities that weren't in combat. He didn't have enough ammunition, so he took control of a foundry and manufactured more ammunition himself. The siege of Toulon was a huge victory for the French. The government saw Napoleon as a hero. Nothing was going on, they hadn't seen any big victories, and now they had one. And it was because of Napoleon. He was made a general at the age of 24 and his career took off from there. Napoleon won because of his refusal to accept what was handed to him. Because he didn't follow those that had come before. Because he was willing to take over a foundry to make his own ammunition. His desire to win is explained by one critical personality trait: high-agency. What is High-Agency? High-agency is the idea that the story given to you about what you can or cannot do is just that - a story. You have control over the story and the way you act determines how that story ends. Shreyas Doshi describes it as ""an attitude I've seen in every successful leader I've known."" George Mack says it's ""arguably the most important personality trait you can foster."" It's about finding a way to defeat the status quo and figure out how to get what you want, despite everyone telling you it can't be done. The way someone responds to difficult problems is a useful proxy for how much agency they have. Napoleon could've accepted his lack of supplies and tried to make the best of a bad situation. He could've said that it wasn't his fault for being placed in that position. He could've continued on the path of the failed commanders before. Instead, he decided that he wouldn't put up with it. The mathematician and economist Eric Weinstein describes high-agency as: ""When you're told that something is impossible, is that the end of the conversation, or does that start a second dialogue in your mind about how to get around whoever it is that's just told you that you can't do something? So, how am I going to get past this bouncer who told me that I can't come into this nightclub? How am I going to start a business when my credit is terrible and I have no experience?"" The Best Founders Have Agency in Spades High-agency is common - almost universal - amongst great founders. Steve Jobs said that ""Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use."" People have spoken of Jobs' ""reality distortion field"" and this is really what it was. It was the ability to convince others that the world doesn't have to work how you've been told it works. He believed more in his own agency - his own power to change and affect things - than he did in conventional wisdom or other people's opinions. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. People who don't believe in their own agency find themselves with very little of it. Believing you can do something doesn't mean you can, but it's very unlikely that you'll be able to do something you don't believe you can do. This thread from Ankur Nagpal - founder of Teachable, which was acquired for $250 million - shows examples of what it means for a startup to act with agency. He talks about the small, unscalable acts that helped him and his team land early customers. In the thread, Ankur says: 'Behind every startup that you think has their shit together is usually a culture of insane jugaad'. Jugaad is an Indian term. It's about solving problems using limited resources in innovative ways. It's about figuring out how to win when the odds are stacked against you. It's the conversation in your head about how to get around the people that told you that you can't do something. Jugaad is agency, and its emergence across different languages and cultures makes it worth paying attention to. Agency is worth fostering because we need fewer people who are resigned to the status quo. We need more people who are willing to take risks and ignore people that say no. We need more boldness and questioning and craziness and disruption. We need more agency. This is part 1 in the high-agency series. Part 2 looks at examples of high-agency. Part 3 explains how to begin fostering it yourself.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/you-need-to-show-more-agency","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/you-need-to-show-more-agency","265489","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/j497sytuel/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-you-need-to-show-more-agency.html"

I was good at memorising things and taking tests, so I got good grades, but my understanding of concepts rarely scratched below the surface. When you're getting good grades and winning awards, you tend to think that you're on the right track. Teachers tell you that you're doing what you're supposed to and family members tell you that they're proud of you. I attached my identity to the status and prestige that came with that. After school, I went to university and studied law. I didn't choose law because I found it interesting. I chose it because of the status and wealth given to lawyers. I enrolled without questioning things, without stopping to think about what I actually enjoyed, found fascinating, or wanted to dedicate my life to. But the good grades kept coming. It's probably the worst thing that could have happened. If I'd failed I would've been forced to confront the fact that I didn't understand things properly. I would've realised that memorising is not the same as understanding. That I needed to figure out what I actually wanted to do instead of following the path of status and prestige. Failing would have stopped me from deceiving myself. I'd spent almost five years studying to be an attorney when I decided that I wanted to be a software engineer. I was playing catch up and trying to join people years ahead of me. I couldn't fake understanding. There were no tests I could prepare for that would falsely signal a sense of competency. I had to learn and practice and develop a deep understanding of the world I wanted to operate in. It took about 10 months but I landed a position as an engineer. That journey gave me a thirst for knowledge and understanding. Not the superficial understanding that gets you good grades, but the understanding that lies at the heart of a nuanced worldview. There's nothing I crave more. It's so easy to think that you understand something when you actually don't. Feynman said that the first rule of science is that you do not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. This is why writing is important. You can't lie to yourself when you write. You can either put the words on the page or you can't. And if you can't you'd better get back to reading and wrestling with the topic until you can. I can't stress how empowering it feels to sit down and write out of sheer desire to understand something. There's no grade, no deadline, no judgment. You're doing it because you're wrestling with something. Because you want to quench your thirst for knowledge. Few things are as satisfying as taming a beast you've been battling with. ""My countervailing advice to people trying to understand something is: go slow. Read slowly, think slowly, really spend time pondering the thing. Start by thinking about the question yourself before reading a bunch of stuff about it. A week or a month of continuous pondering about a question will get you surprisingly far."" - Nabeel Qureshi Writing forces you to go slow.

In summer, the trees lining the road grow over the top, forming a tunnel. It turns out that tree tunnels are a thing, and there are some beautiful ones around the world. Friction is generally seen as something to remove. Less friction allows you to move further for the same effort. By definition, reduced friction means improved efficiency. But the friction between trains and trees creates something beautiful. It shows that there's more to friction than you might have imagined, that friction can be good. I think of friction as a function. You go in one way and come out another. To be more specific, friction is a one-way function. A brief primer on one-way functions: It's easy to turn a cow into a hamburger; not as easy to turn a hamburger into a cow. In one-way functions, transformation happens easily in one way, but not the other. Friction is the same. It changes you in some fundamental way and you never really go back to the person you were before. Friction represents an opportunity and a leverage point. For individuals, friction can be used to make you different and indispensable. It's not that you become indispensable merely because you're different, but that the only way to be indispensable is to be different. If you're the same, so are plenty of other people. The only way to get what you're worth is to stand out, to be seen as indispensable, and to produce work that organisations and people care deeply about. I've written more about this here. For companies, friction represents a point that needs smoothing over. Figure out how to do it and you'll be rewarded handsomely. Shopify did it with setting up online stores. They handle the boring stuff, like payments, so that you can focus on the important stuff, like making your first sale. Replit does it for programmers by removing the technical barriers and allowing them to focus on the learning. Friction is more nuanced than that though. Remove too much friction and you become a convenience store. If you sell convenience, this is a useful way to think about friction. Amazon wins by making it ridiculously convenient for consumers to purchase and receive goods, by removing as much friction as possible from the shopping experience. There's space for convenience stores, but not as much as you'd think. You're also unlikely to beat Amazon at convenience. To be indispensable, you need to figure out how to use friction to your advantage. You need to know which friction to keep, and which to remove. Commerce - a construct as old as civilization - is undergoing a transformation driven by friction. There's an explosion of consumer brands using the internet as their primary sales channel. Most want to connect directly with their customers and own that relationship. This isn't just independent sellers or small companies, but global behemoths like Unilever and Heinz. While Heinz used to sell trucks of ketchup to other businesses, they now want to go direct to the consumers. This is where Shopify comes in. Shopify understands that good friction is at the core of commerce. They aren't trying to remove all friction from commerce, but rather the bad friction that makes it difficult for store-owners to get started. Stuff like building a website, handling payments, and managing logistics. Shopify handles the repetitive and boring parts of entrepreneurship - the bad friction - so that their users can focus on the good friction, like figuring out how to land their first sale. Should that first sale be completely easy? No one can do that for you. You have to figure out how to do it, and when you do, you'll feel growth. That's good friction. Shopify isn't the only company that understands friction. If you're teaching someone to program, you want to remove the friction of having to set up an environment and handle dependencies. That's exactly what Replit did by building a browser-based IDE that supports almost any language and allows users to start coding from any device in a matter of minutes. No downloads, no errors, no bad friction. Replit takes care of the bad friction associated with learning to code so that users can focus on the good friction.","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/what-you-need-to-understand-about","https://chasingmelody.substack.com/p/what-you-need-to-understand-about","273968","https://ffcloud.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fetchfox-docs/2bwyadna6h/https-chasingmelody-substack-com-p-what-you-need-to-understand-about.html"

""I realised that there are multiple avenues of failure, like financial failure or failure of it just not working. But the failure we were most afraid of was that the company would work, and then ten or twenty years down the road, it would be a company that we would no longer want to be hired by."" - Tobi Lütke I started learning and writing about Shopify because it seemed a fascinating place to work.
