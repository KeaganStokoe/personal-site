                <p>Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone in 2007, in what is now considered a legendary demo of a legendary product. Jobs spoke extensively about keyboards. Most phones at the time had physical keyboards - flat plastic keyboards that took up the bottom half of the phone, below a little screen.</p>

                <p>Jobs slammed this design: (These phones) all have these keyboards that are there whether you need them or not. And they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic, and are the same for every application ‚Ä¶ well, every application wants a slightly different user interface, a slightly optimised set of buttons just for it. And what happens if you think of a great idea six months from now - you can't add a button to these things - they're already shipped! So what do you do?</p>

                <p>He argued that the solution was a software keyboard, displayed on a large touchscreen, and adapted to every application on the phone. Ken Kocienda led the design and engineering of the iPhone keyboard.</p>

                <p>[‚Ä¶] Action wins.</p>
