            <div class="post-content">
                <p>As a kid, my dad worked as a firefighter. I celebrated my 4th birthday at the station. After a while, he became a paramedic. He didn't talk much about his experiences, but I know they weren't pleasant. It can't be easy responding to a car crash in the middle of the night, to then come home and continue like you hadn't just witnessed the death of someone the same age as your son.</p>
                
                <p>As you can imagine, he was always the first person called in an emergency. Somebody's hurt? Call Dad. Broken bone? Call Dad. You need an ambulance? Call Dad. No matter what he encountered, he never grew flustered.</p>
                
                <p>I've come to view calmness as a superpower. Something worth practising. An emotion to be called on.</p>
                
                <p>Here's why:</p>
                
                <p>Calmness makes everybody around you better. When one person stays calm, it's easier for others to do the same. That leads to better thinking and decision-making.</p>
                
                <p>Calmness is valuable in every single situation. I can't think of a scenario where it isn't useful. Whether your house is burning down, you're closing the biggest deal of your life, or your bride is walking down the aisle, you want to feel calm.</p>
                
                <p>Calmness quiets the lizard brain. In a state of panic, your amygdala, which is your lizard brain, takes over and puts you in a fight-or-flight state. You seek the quickest decision that guarantees survival. It makes it difficult to think laterally or creatively.</p>
                
                <p>Calmness quiets the amygdala so that you can assess the situation and explore different perspectives. You can come up with creative and new ideas. That's valuable in every setting, but it's particularly valuable in a business setting where, ironically, creative thinking and lateral ideas are your survival.</p>
                
                <p>Stay calm.</p>
